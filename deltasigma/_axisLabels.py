    """Utility function to quickly generate the alphanum. axis labels.

    **Parameters:**

    ran : sequence
        Sequence containing the axis points (floats)

    incr : int, or 2-elements sequence
        This parameter may be:

    * an int, the function returns an array of strings corresponding to:
      each element of ``range[0]:range[-1]:incr`` formatted as ``'%g'``.

    * a list, the function returns an array of strings corresponding to:
      each element of ``incr[1]:range[-1]:incr[0]`` formatted as ``'%g'``.

    .. note:: All elements in ``ran`` less than 1e-6 are rounded down to 0.

    **Returns:**

    labels : list of strings

    **Raises:**

    ValueError: "Unrecognised incr."
