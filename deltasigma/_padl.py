    x : ndarray
        The matrix to be padded.

    n : int
        The number of columns of the matrix after padding.

    val : scalar, optional
        The value to be used used for padding.

    .. note:: A 1-d array, for example ``a.shape == (N,)`` is reshaped to be

    The empty matrix is assumed to be have 1 empty row.

    **Returns:**

        The padded matrix.
