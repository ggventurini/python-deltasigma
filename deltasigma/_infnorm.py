    **Parameters:**

    H : object
        the LTI description of the DT system, which can be in one of the
        following forms:

        * an LTI object,
        * a zpk tuple,
        * a (num, den) tuple,
        * an ABCD matrix (internally converted to zpk representation),
        * a list-like containing the A, B, C, D matrices (also internally
          converted to zpk representation).

    **Returns:**

    Hinf : float
           The infinity norm of ``H``.
    fmax : float
           The frequency to which Hinf corresponds.
